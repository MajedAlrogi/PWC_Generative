Under this scheme, employees could invest their end of service benefits in reputable funds, enabling them to receive returns upon completion of their service.   Employers choosing to participate in the scheme will need to contribute monthly to an investment fund. These contributions will entitle beneficiaries (employees) to receive the allocated basic subscription amount, along with any investment returns generated, in place of their end of service benefits.   Objectives of the scheme The Savings scheme aims to protect employees from inflation, default and bankruptcy. It also aims employees to benefit from investing in various economic activities in the UAE.   Investment options The scheme offers a variety of investment options, which include: Sharia-compliant funds a capital guarantee portfolio option that offers a risk-free investment, for unskilled workers and various other investment portfolios that carry varying levels of financial risk based on expected return.

Employers must select and contract with one of the investment funds licensed by Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) to provide these services. They must also determine which employee categories and levels should be included in the scheme.   Companies must discontinue the use of the current end of service benefits system for employees who are selected to participate in this scheme.   Once the employees are chosen, participation in the fund becomes mandatory, and employers must ensure that the employees' entitlements from the previous period are preserved.   Basic subscription fee Employers’ contribution to the investment fund for full-time employees is as follows: 5.83 per cent of their employees’ monthly basic salary if the employee has not completed five years of service 8.33 per cent if the employee has served more than five years.   Subscriptions must be transferred into the investment fund within 15 days of the beginning of each calendar month.   Additional voluntary subscription In addition to the basic subscription made by the employers, subscribed employees may contribute voluntarily a percentage of their salary or an additional amount, either in instalments or as lump sum.   The voluntary contribution will be deducted from their salaries, provided it does not exceed 25 per cent of the total annual salary.

Employees can withdraw part or all of the voluntary contributions or their investment returns at any time during their employment, in accordance with terms set forth by the fund manager.
